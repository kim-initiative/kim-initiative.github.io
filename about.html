                            the California Gold Rush, Levi Strauss provided tough pants, later called blue jeans,
                            to help prospectors seeking gold do their work. A
                            similar gold rush to discover new advanced materials is underway through
                            the White House <a href="https://www.mgi.gov/" target="_blank">Materials
                                Genome Initiative (MGI)</a>, supercharged by the artificial intelligence
                            (AI) revolution. Through a collection of companion projects, the
                            Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models (KIM) Initiative is providing the
                            “blue jeans” for the community of materials science prospectors who are
                            seeking to revolutionize technologies across the sciences. <br><br>

                            The MGI vision is for “discovering, manufacturing, and deploying advanced
                            materials twice as fast and at a fraction of the cost compared to
                            traditional methods.” To do so, scientists must work together, combining
                            advanced computations, experiments, and data. A key tool in the materials
                            discovery toolbox are molecular simulations in which the behavior of a
                            material is modeled by considering the interactions between its
                            constituent atoms. This allows scientists to do “what if” experiments in a
                            computer, trying out different material compositions without having to
                            physically manufacture them, thereby saving time, money, and energy. <br><br>

                            The collection of projects under the KIM INITIATIVE provide tools and
                            resources to researchers in materials science and chemistry who are using
                            molecular simulations to revolutionize technologies across the sciences.</p>
